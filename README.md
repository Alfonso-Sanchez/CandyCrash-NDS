# CandyCrash-NDS Project - My Contribution

## Overview

This repository contains my contributions to the CandyCrash-NDS project. It includes the code I developed, along with dependency files provided by other team members.

## My Work

### `/source/` Directory

*   **`candy1_init`**: Complete file with all corresponding routines.
*   **`RSI_Timer0`**: Modifications to sections 2Ea, 2Eb, 2Ec, and 2Ed.
*   **`candy2_graf`**: Modifications to sections 2Aa and 2Ab.

## Testing

A testing `main` file is included to demonstrate the functionality of my contributions. This allows you to observe:

*   Generation of the numerical table (top) and sprite table (bottom).
*   Movement of sprites when recombining elements.

## Required Software

The following software is required to compile and view the code:

*   [Pnotepad](https://www.pnotepad.org/)
